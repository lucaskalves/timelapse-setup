# Time-lapse animations with a Raspberry Pi 

In this resource you'll write a small script to capture multiple images, using a Pi camera over a long period of time. These images can then be combined into an animated GIF, allowing you to view very slow events in a few seconds, using the power of time-lapse photography.
